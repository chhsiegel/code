# Code

Code I've created for different projects.

Folders:
1) MHT IV: Multiple Hypothesis Testing in an instrumental variable setting, using Romano & Wolf's adjustment.
2) Networks: Code related to the paper "Better Together? Social Networks in Truancy and the Targeting of
Treatment" (Bennett & Bergman, 2019)
3) Template_Matching: Code and data for simulation study of the paper "Building Representative Matched Samples with Multi-valued Treatments in Large Observational Studies" (Bennett, Vielma, & Zubizarreta, 2019)
4) geocodeAPI: Reverse geocode function to get addresses (and its elements) from lat/lon, using Google's geocode API (code adapted from Kei Saito)
5) geographic_characterization: Python script (for ArcGIS) to characterize a geographic area (e.g. school districts) using census tract level data.
