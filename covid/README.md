## COVID-19 repository

Here I'll be adding updated data and some maps for the spread of COVID-19 in Chile! (Note: Data publicly provided by Ministerio de Salud, and locations obtained through Google Maps)

1) data_covid.csv: Data from the Ministry for tested individuals (+), with location according to the testing center.
2) maps_covid_public.R: Quick R code to generate maps for GIFs.
